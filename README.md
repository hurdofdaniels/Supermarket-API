# Supermarket API
This is a API that collects data from all the New Zealand supermarkets, It's built in python 3.7.3.
I'm making this product because in the future I'm going to make a shopping list that grabs the best price for the same item.

## How it works?
Some supermarkets have API and some call a database onload, so it will use Beautiful Soup to scrap the database websites and it will use the built-in requests library to call the API.
